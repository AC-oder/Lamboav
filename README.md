# Lamboav
FiveM resource created by a_coder

First let me start off by saying that i did not create this addon. All i did was turn the addon into a FiveM resource so that you can put this vehicle into your FiveM server file.

Credit for the vehicle add-on goes to: yanfenglenfan

Anyway let me tell you how to install.
I have done all the hard work already, so all you have to do is just place the folder inside the resource folder.

Step 1) Download the resource from my github.
Step 2) Open the folder with the lamboav folder and the Readme.txt inside.
Step 3) Drag the lamboav folder inside your resource folder in your FXServer.
Step 4) Once the resource is inside your resource folder then go to your servers server.cfg.
Step 5) Scroll down to the bottom of your resources list in your server.cfg and add the text 'start lamboav'.
Now the resource will be in your server.
